                            I’m a masters’ student pursuing a MS in Computer
                            Science at Columbia University. My interests span
                            the full product development process, from user
                            research and prototyping to system implementation
                            and design. When I’m not programming, you can find
                            me playing saxophone and piano or baking fresh
                            bread. I’m currently looking for internship
                            positions for summer 2021. Check out some of my
                            projects below - including the website itself! And
                            please contact me with any questions or
                            opportunities.
